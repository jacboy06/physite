                <h2>Your New Home</h2>
                <p id='planetdbody'>Once you arrive on Osiris, you may notice some subtle differences in your new home. First, the year on Osiris is only 341 days long, rather than 365. Second, the gravity is 3.3% stronger, which means you may register a couple extra pounds on the scale. The planet has a thick and colorful atmosphere, so any horizon will appear closer than it would on Earth. The higher oxygen content makes it easier to breath on the surface. It won't take long for you to get used to the extra gravity, which means you will be able to dive right in to the new culture. As this is one of the later colonization trips, food and infrastructure will have already been established for your convenience. Unfortunately, there are not many plants or animals aside from those we have taken with us. Luckily, all current lodging on the ship is designed to disconnect and become your new home.</p>
